This Mediawiki Extension was written by user Egel on mediawiki.  Tobixen has nothing to do with this, except that he has been asked to install it on a mediawiki instance, and find it unacceptable to source it directly from a wiki page.

If anyone wants to take over this project, please don't hesitate to get in touch.  t-github@tobixen.no.
